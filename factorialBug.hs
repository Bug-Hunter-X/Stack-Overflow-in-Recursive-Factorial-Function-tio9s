This Haskell code attempts to calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive function. However, it contains a common error: it doesn't handle the base case (factorial of 0) correctly, leading to infinite recursion and a stack overflow.
```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```
